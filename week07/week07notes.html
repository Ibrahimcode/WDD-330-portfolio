        <h3>Further Functions</h3>
        <p class="notes note-paragraph">
          
          <ol class="sets-key-points">
            <li>
                Functions are first-class objects.
                
            </li>
            <li>They can have properties and methods themselves.

            </li>
            <li>Functions have length property that returns the number of parameters the function has.
              

          </ol>
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="memory-leaks note-section">

        <h3>Call And Apply Methods</h3>
        <p class="memory note-paragraph">
          The call method can be use to set the value  of "this" inside a function to an objecct that is <br>

          provided as the first argument.
          
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="funtion note-section">
        <h3>Custom  Properties</h3>
        <p class="function note-paragraph">
          We can add properties to a function in the same way we add properties to any object in JavaScript.
          
        </p>
        <h3>Memoization</h3>
        <p class="function note-paragraph">
            This provides result caching if a function takes some time to complete a return value, we can save <br>
            the return in a cach property.
            
        </p>
        <h3>Immediately Invoke Function Expressions - or IIFE</h3>
        <p>IIFE is an anonymous function that is invole as soon as it is define. This is clearly archieved by placing <br>
        parentheses at the end of the function. This function also has to be made into an expression which is done <br>
        by placing the whole declaration inside parentheses.    
        </p>
        <h3>Function That Defines And Rewrite themselves</h3>
        <p>
            <ol>
                <li>Functions In JavaScript are able to not only call itself, but define itself, and even redefine itself.</li>
                <li>This is done by assigning an anonymous function to a variable that has the same name as the function.</li>
            </ol>
        </p>
        <h3>Lossing Properties</h3>
        <p>
            If any property has previously  been set on the function, this will be lost when the function redefines itself.
        </p>
        <h3>Recursive Functions.</h3>
        <p>
            A recursive function is one that invoke itself until a certain condition is met.
        </p>
        <h3>Callbacks</h3>
        <p>
            Callbacks are functions that passed to other functions as argument and then invoke inside the function they are <br>
            passed to.
        </p>
        <h3>AJAX</h3>
        <p>
            AJAX is a technique that allows web pages to communicate asynchronously with a server, and it dynamically update <br>
            web pages without reloading. <br>
            
            This enables data to be sent and recieved in the background



        </p>
        <h3>API'<sup>s</sup> </h3>
        <p>
            An Application Programming Interface (API) is a collection of methods that allows extend access to another program or <br>
            service.
        </p>
        <h3>Hyper Text Transfer Protocol</h3>
        <p>HTTP is a standard or protocole use to transger data accross the web</p> <br>
        The five commonly HTTP verbs are:
        <ol>
            <li>GET: request to retrieve resources</li>
            <li>POST: request; usually use to create a resource, but can actually perform any task</li>
            <li>PUT: request to upset, which means to insert a resource or upadate it evenly</li>
            <li>PATCH: request to make partial updates to a resource</li>
            <li>DELETE: request to delete a resource</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>AJAX Example</h3>
        <p  >
