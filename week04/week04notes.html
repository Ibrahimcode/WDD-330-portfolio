        <h3>Forms</h3>
        <p class="notes note-paragraph">
          The lagacy DOM have a usefull property called <b>document.forms</b> that returns a collection of all the form in the <br>
          document in the order they appear in the markup.
          <ol class="sets-key-points">
            <li>
                form also use indexing.
                <ul><li>eg. const form = document.forms[0];</li></ul>
            </li>
            <li>We can also search form using it name attributes

              <ul><li>eg. const form = document.forms.search; (assume search is the form name.)</li></ul>
            </li>
            <li>Forms object also jave a method called elements that return an HTML collection of all the elemetns contain in the form. <span class="highlight"></span>
              <ul><li>eg. const [input, button] = forms.elements;</li></ul>
              <span class="highlight"></span>  <span class="highlight"></span>
            </li>
            <li>We can also access forms controls using name attributes.
              <ul><li>eg. const input = forms.searchInput;</li>
                   <li>eg. const input = forms[searchInput];</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>forms.submit() will submit the form authomatically.</li>
            <li>forms.reset() will reset all the form controls back to it initial values. </li>

        <h3>Object Oriented Programming</h3>
        <p class="function note-paragraph">
          Object Oriented Programming is a style of programming that involves separating the code into objects that <br>
          have properties and methods.
          <ol class="function-key-points">
            <li><h3>The Main Concept of OOP</h3>
                <ol><li>Encapsulation</li>
                    <li>Polymorphism</li>
                    <li>Inheritance</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>Classes are defined as a blueprint of an object; objects are then created as an instance of that class <br>
                and inherited all the properties and methods of that class.
            </li>
            <li>Static Methods : are method that are called directly by it class rather than by instance of that class</li>
            <li>To make a property private, use an understand (_) as the first character in the property's name.
                <ul><li>eg. _color</li></ul>
            </li>
            <li>A class can inherit from another class using the <b>extentds</b> keyword in the class declaration.</li>
            <li><h4>Polymorphism:</h4>
                <ul><li>The concept of polymorphism means that diffennt objects can have the same methods, <br>
                        implement them in the in different ways. This means the methods can be override.
                </li></ul>
            </li>

            
          </ol>

        </p>
        <h4>Mixins:</h4>
        <p>Mixins is a way of adding properties and methods of some object to another object without using inheritance.</p>
        
        <h4>Modular JavaScript:</h4>
        <p>A module is a self contain peice of code that provide functions and methods that can then be used <br>
           in other file and by other modules. They allow you to keep part of a code in a self contained files.
