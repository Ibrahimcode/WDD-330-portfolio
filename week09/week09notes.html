            <h3>The Window Object </h3>
            <p class="notes note-paragraph">
                Every JavaScript environment has a <b>global object</b> . And any variables that are created
                in the global scope are actually properties of <br> this object, and any functions are
                methods of it. <br>
                In a browser environment the global object is the window object,
                which represents the browser window that contains a web page.
            </p>

            <h3>The Browser Object Model</h3>
            <p class="notes note-paragraph">
                The Browser Object Model (or BOM for short) is a collection of properties and
                methods that contain information about the browser and computer screen.
                <ol class="sets-key-points">
                    <li>
                        The Broswer Object Model can only make sense in a Broswer environment.
                        
                    </li>
                   
                   
        
                </ol>
            </p>
            <h3>Global Variable</h3>
            <p class="notes note-paragraph">
                These are variables that are created without using the const , let or var
                keywords.
                <ol class="sets-key-points">
                    <li>
                        Global variables can be accessed in all parts of the program.
                        
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Global variables are actual properties of a global object.
            
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        
                        In a browser environment, the global object is the window object. 
                        This means that any global variable created is actually a property of the
                        window object.

                    </li>
                    
        
                </ol>
            </p>

      <div class="memory-leaks note-section">

        <h3>Dialogs</h3>
        <p class="memory note-paragraph">
          The three functions that produced dialogs in the
          browsers are: alert() , confirm() and prompt() .

          <ol class="sets-key-points">
            <li>
                <h4>window.alert()</h4>
                The window.alert() method will pause the execution of the program and display  <br>
                a message in a dialog box.

                
                
            </li>
            <li><h4>window.confirm()</h4>
                The window.confirm() method will stop the execution of the program and <br>
                display a confirmation dialog that shows the message provided as an argument, <br>
                and giving the options of OK or Cancel. <br>
                t returns the boolean values of true if the user clicks OK, and false if the user <br> 
                clicks Cancel:
    
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Window.alert()</h4>
                The window.prompt() method will stop the execution of the program. It displays <br>
                a dialog that shows a message provided as an argument, as well as an input field <br>
                that allows the user to enter text.  <br>
                This text is then returned as a string when the user clicks OK. If the user clicks Cancel, <br>
                null is returned:

            </li>
            
            

        </ol>
          
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="funtion note-section">
        <h3>Browser Information  </h3>
        <p class="function note-paragraph">
            The window object has a number of properties and methods that provide <br>
            information about the user’s browser.

            <ol>
                <li> 
                    <h4>window.location</h4>
                    The window.location property is an object that contains information about the <br>
                    URL of the current page.
               </li>

            </ol>
          
        </p>

        <h3>The Browser History</h3>
        <p class="function note-paragraph">
            The window.history property can be used to access information about any <br>
            previously visited pages in the current browser session.
            <ol>
                <li> 
                    <h4>window.history.length</h4>
                    The window.history.length property shows how many pages have been visited <br>
                    before arriving at the current page.
               </li>
               <li> <h4>window.history.go()</h4>
                The window.history.go() method can be used to go to a specific page, where 0 <br>
                is the current page:
               </li>
            </ol>
          
        </p>
        <h3>Controlling window</h3>
        <p>
            A new window can be opened using the window.open() method. This takes the <br>
            URL of the page to be opened as its first parameter, the window title as its second <br>
            parameter, and a list of attributes as the third parameter. <br>
            The close() method can be used to close a window
        </p>

        <h3>Screen Information</h3>
        <p>
            The window.screen object contains information about the screen the browser is <br>
            displayed on.
            <ol>
                <li>
                    You can find out the height and width of the screen in pixels using
                    the height and width properties.
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            eg. window.screen.height
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                </li>
            </ol>
