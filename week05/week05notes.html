        <h3>Testing And Debugging.</h3>
        <h3>Errors, Exceptions, and Warning.</h3>
        <p class="notes note-paragraph">
          Errors are caursed when something goes wrong In a program. <br>
          The types of errors that commonly occurs are as follows:
          <ol class="sets-key-points">
            <li>System Errors.</li>
            <li>Programmer Errors.</li>
            <li>User Errors </li>
            </ol>
        </p>
        <p>
          Exception is an error that produce a return value that can be used by <br>
          the program to deal with the error.
        </p>
        <p>
          Stack Traces are sequence of functions or methods calls that lead to the <br>
          points where the error occured.
        </p>
        <p>
          Warnings: A warning can occur if there is an error in the code that is not <br>
          enough to caurse the program to crash.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="memory-leaks note-section">

        <h3>Strict Mode</h3>
        <p class="memory note-paragraph">
          Strict mode produce more exceptiona and warnings, and prohibits the use of <br>
          some depreciated features.
          <ol class="memory-points">
            <li>Add the following string to the first line of a JavaScript file in other <br>
              to use strict mode. <ul><li>'use strict'</li></ul> </li> 
            <li>Strict mode can also be invoke on a per function basis.</li>
            <li>Modules are in a strict mode by default.</li>
          </ol>
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="memory-leaks note-section">

        <h3>Linting Tools</h3>
        <p class="memory note-paragraph">
          Linting tools can be use to test the quality of a JavaScript code beyond the simply <br>
          using Strict mode.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="memory-leaks note-section">

        <h3>Debugging</h3>
        <p class="memory note-paragraph">
          debugging is the process of finding out where bugs or errors occur in the code and <br>
          then dealing with them.
          <ol class="memory-points">
            <li>The most basic form of debugging is to use the alert() method to alert a dialog <br>
              message at certain points in the code.
               </li>
            <li>We can also use the console (console.log()) to log the valur of a variable at by <br>
              
              different stages of the program during development.</li>
            
          </ol>
